# Checkout form page template

## Overview

- *Continue work on your `ecommerce-pattern-library`*
- Use your previously designed patterns to create the checkout form page for your eCommerce website.
- Inside your `pages` folder make a new single HTML file—name it so that it matches your navigation. *And don’t forget to connect it into the navigation.*
- **Use Patternbot’s include system to avoid rewriting or copying-and-pasting the pattern HTML.**
- *You should only write HTML and insert appropriate classes like `.grid` and type sizes.*
- **Your checkout form page does not get its own CSS file.** If you cannot create the page without writing CSS, your patterns aren’t good enough. Go back to the patterns and add variations. Or make a brand new pattern.
- Remember that Patternbot will automatically add all your CSS files to the top of the page. This is exactly why it’s super important that your patterns do not target HTML tags directly because at this point there **will** be collisions.
- *Run your pattern library through Markbot and make sure it passes all the checks.*
